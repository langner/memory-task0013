The archives contain the images obtained from Amit, all converted to JPEG with a sampling factor of 1x1 (some were TIFFs and some JPEGS with the same quality). Filenames in the unzipped directories were appended with the size of the scale bar in the images. The images I don't want to analyze (and doubled images -- there were a few) were removed, or moved to the sem-misc folder above this one if interesting for some other reason.

Previously chosen concentrations for 5k: C9 (200), C8 (235), C6 (430), C5 (630), C3 (700), C1 (1000).
